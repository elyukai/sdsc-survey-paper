 abstract = {In the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT), an increasing number of embedded devices of all sorts (e.g., sensors, mobile phones, cameras, smart meters, smart cars, traffic lights, smart home appliances, etc.) are now capable of communicating and sharing data over the Internet. Although the concept of using embedded systems to control devices, tools and appliances has been proposed for almost decades now, with every new generation, the ever-increasing capabilities of computation and communication pose new opportunities, but also new challenges. As IoT becomes an active research area, different methods from various points of view have been explored to promote the development and popularity of IoT. One trend is viewing IoT as Web of Things (WoT) where the open Web standards are supported for information sharing and device interoperation. By penetrating smart things into existing Web, the conventional web services are enriched with physical world services. This WoT vision enables a new way of narrowing the barrier between virtual and physical worlds. In this paper, we elaborate the architecture and some key enabling technologies of WoT. Some pioneer open platforms and prototypes are also illustrated. The most recent research results are carefully summarized. Furthermore, many systematic comparisons are made to provide the insight in the evolution and future of WoT. Finally, we point out some open challenging issues that shall be faced and tackled by research community.},

 abstract = {Recently, Internet has evolved into a new generation, called Internet of Things, thus enabling the connection between the physical and the digital worlds by creating an ubiquitous and self-organizing network. A huge number of smart objects are becoming now identifiable and addressable while being able to communicate with each other. Moreover, the integration of cloud infrastructures in the design of IoT, has moved this new trademark technology into a new dimension, enabling virtualisation and service provisioning. Billions of cloud services with different performance levels, requirements and functionalities are thus being offered in IoT, raising however the issues of their management, discovery and selection. In the literature, a considerable effort has been invested to address service discovery and selection in the context of IoT, despite the lack of standardization that meets the IoT requirements. In this paper, we propose an exhaustive taxonomy to classify service discovery approaches in the context of IoT, that we subsequently evaluate according to different aspects and criteria. Then, we discuss the gaps and advantages of each class of our taxonomy and locate the context and the requirements under which each can operate. Finally, we identify the challenges and future research directions in this domain.

 abstract = {As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices proliferates, the magnitude and velocity of data continues to increase rapidly. IoT systems rely primarily on using messaging protocols for exchanging IoT data and there exists several protocols or frameworks that support distinct types of messaging patterns. Given that IoT devices typically have limited computational resources and processing power, choosing a lightweight, reliable, scalable, interoperable, extensible and secure messaging protocol becomes a very challenging task. As a result, it is not uncommon that IoT systems may employ multiple messaging protocols for supporting device heterogeneity and different message exchange patterns. In addition, basic similarities among existing several messaging protocols or frameworks that exist today for exchanging IoT data within IoT systems suggest the potential of interoperability. Given that IoT systems help facilitate the interconnectivity among distributed, heterogeneous entities, interoperability among existing messaging protocols will play an increasingly important role in simplifying the development and deployment of IoT systems. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the existing messaging protocols that can be used in deploying IoT systems. Throughout this paper, we highlight the protocols’ distinctive approaches and applicability of using them across various IoT environments. In addition, we highlight challenges, strengths and weaknesses of these messaging protocols in the context of IoT.},

 abstract = {Publish/subscribe messaging pattern is often used as a communication mechanism in data-oriented applications and is becoming wide-spread, especially due to the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) services and applications. In addition to MQTT , which is one of the commonly used publish/subscribe protocols in the context of IoT, there are a number of other message queuing solutions, either open or proprietary. We have designed a CloUd-based PUblish/Subscribe (CUPUS) middleware solution within the framework of the FP7 project OpenIoT1 that has developed an open-source cloud platform for the IoT. CUPUS is one of the core OpenIoT components which enables flexible integration of wearable sensors and mobile devices as data sources within the OpenIoT platform. In this paper we compare MQTT and CUPUS in the context of smart city application scenarios. Smart city services pose different key-requirements on IoT publish/subscribe solutions and thus we propose a taxonomy to identify vital features of IoT publish/subscribe middleware. The comparison shows that CUPUS is more appropriate for mobile environments with frequent context changes , while it can filter out unrequired data on devices prior to being reported to backend cloud servers. The MQTT protocol proves to be suitable for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and heterogeneous environments due to its small code footprint, low bandwidth usage and standardized interfaces. Finally we evaluate the two solutions in terms of message footprint in a real-world scenario, latency and delivery semantics.},

In this paper, we propose a LoRaWAN network with autonomous base stations that can work without Internet connectivity for essential services, while being able to provide additional features whenever Internet access becomes available, even in an intermittent fashion. Security and privacy are preserved, with support for mobile nodes.},

An IoT technology stack provides seamless connectivity between various physical and virtual objects. The increasing number of IoT applications leads to the issue of transmitting, storing, and processing a large amount of data. Therefore, it is necessary to enable a system capable to handle the growing traffic requirements with the required level of QoS (Quality of Service). IoT devices become more complex due to the various components such as sensors and network interfaces. The IoT environment is often demanding for mobile power source, QoS, mobility, reliability, security, and other requirements. Therefore, new IoT technologies are required to overcome some of these issues. In recent years new wireless communication technologies are being developed to support the development of new IoT applications. This paper provides an overview of some of the most widely used wireless communication technologies used for IoT applications.}

A network model is proposed and a typical practical scenario is developed based on MQTT protocol, that cope with the requirements of some Smart City applications, mainly those which use event-based messages. Many market-available embedded electronic systems were employed for this scenario including the inexpensive Wi-Fi platform ESP8266, Arduino, Raspberry, in addition to some sensors and actuators. The network model is chosen based on the TCP/IP model, and the application layer is totally depending on the MQTT protocol that employs JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to solve the problem of interoperability. To evaluate the protocol for small-to-medium, IoT-based, business applications of Smart Cities, some available free Open Source Software (OSS) of MQTT servers and clients were compared and tested against latency over the cloud. The protocol shows good results for cloud-based, small-to-medium business applications that depend on event-based message-oriented communication paradigms. Since the protocol defines three levels of quality of service (QoS), the simulations and the tests were conducted for QoS type zero (QoS0) to get the best results.},

Any malicious activity has the potential to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of messages exchanged between different vehicles. To ensure secure message communication among the vehicles in a smart city environment, a novel scheme using elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC) technique has been presented in this paper. For this purpose, a two-level authentication key exchange scheme has been designed. In the first level authentication, CH s are verified by series of messages exchanged between CH s and the CA.The verified CH s are responsible for authentication ofvehicles in the second level authentication, followed by exchange of messages between CH and vehicle. The security analysis using widely accepted Burrows–Abadi–Needham logic, formal security analysis using random oracle model and verification using the widely known automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool, and also the informal security analysis have been done with respect to various types of attacks. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the proposed scheme with existing related schemes reveals that it generates low overhead and latency, and high reliability during messages exchange between vehicles and the CA.},

A smart city system aims at a seamless and secure interconnection of sensors, actuators, and data processing resources to ensure digital, efficient, and reliable services. In this article, we present a brief planar overview of a smart city system architecture by introducing the application, sensing, communication, data, and security/privacy planes. Tailoring existing communication protocols and infrastructures to bridge massively deployed sensors and data processing/storage resources introduces unique communication challenges for smart cities. Furthermore, coexistence, integration, and control of dedicated and non-dedicated sensors is a grand challenge while IoT sensors continuously push sensory data through the communication medium towards data processing and analysis planes. While pervasiveness and ubiquity of smart city services are ensured by the interaction of communication and sensing technologies, their robustness and resilience call for customized security and privacy solutions. With these in mind, we focus on sensing/actuation, communication, and security planes of a smart city system and present a comprehensive survey of the challenges and stateof-the-art solutions in each plane. Furthermore, we provide insights for open issues and opportunities in these planes.},

Many approaches have already been put forward for the semantic service discovery or matchmaking task, where each approach uses it's own logical formalism for service descriptions and user goals (i.e. formalized user request). As formalized service descriptions and user requests are used by the matchmaking process, matchmaking algorithm has a tight coupling with the underlying formalism used to describe services and goals. In this paper, we will present how SAWSDL can be used to annotate service descriptions while being agnostic to one particular service modeling formalism. The main contribution of this paper is to extend SAWSDL based service descriptions with the definition of pre and post-conditions using SPARQL query language and OWL-S Schema. We will also show how SPARQL query language can be used to formulate user goals. As a next step, we will present the matchmaking algorithm and prototype based on the matching of SPARQL based conditions and user goals.},

However, in order to reach these important objectives, efficient networking and communication protocols are needed to provide the necessary coordination and control of the various system components. In this paper, we identify the networking characteristics and requirements of smart city applications, and identify the networking protocols that can be used to support the various data traffic flows that are needed between the different components.

In particular, Web Service composition methods can solve complex service integrations. However, in highly dynamic environments, these manual service compositions still requires a lot of effort. To address this challenge, researchers have recently introduced semantic web service composition methods. The growing interest in this topic of semantic web service composition has led to an increasing number of approaches, which has not been systematically surveyed so far. Researchers have reported several surveys in the related areas such as web service composition or semantic web service search. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them provides a survey about these semantic web service compositions in particular. Hence, this review aims to address this issue by identifying existing efforts on semantic web service compositions. The survey focuses on two aspects (i) semantic web service description, as it is an essential aspect for semantic service composition, (ii) semantic web service composition, to identify methods and their implementations on the real world problem.},

In this paper we attempt to answer the question: Are existing ontologies ready to form an ontology framework for annotating real-world devices? By the example of three real-world devices, we review existing ontologies which can be used to describe their facilities, location and etc. And in the end, we present an instrument to generate semantic descriptions for such devices.},

In this regard, the key elements necessary for a successful M-Health system to take place are discovered to be the power consumption and interoperability maintaining factors. In this context, the present study is conducted to devise a special elderly tracking and monitoring system, closely connected to a walking stick device. The proposed design involves a cane cased transmitter node, enabling to send data related to the position and the state of the elderly to a base station, through implementation of the LoRa technology. The latter would then apply the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol to interact with the environment once a fall proves to take place. For the purpose of evaluating the advanced design associated coverage range and power consumption rate, as enhanced via LoRa network, several experimental tests have been administered. The achieved results appear to reveal that the suggested architecture recorded average covered area turns out to be of the rate of 6 km2.},

Consequently, service providers can only access vertical data silos that imply high costs and jeopardize their solutions market potential. It is necessary to transform the current situation with competing non-interoperable IoT platforms into a common ecosystem enabling the emergence of cross-platform, cross-standard, and cross-domain IoT services and applications. This paper presents a platform that has been implemented for realizing this vision. It leverages semantic web technologies to address the two key challenges in expanding the IoT beyond product silos into web-scale open ecosystems: data interoperability and resources identification and discovery. The paper provides extensive description of the proposed solution and its implementation details. Regarding the implementation details, it is important to highlight that the platform described in this paper is currently supporting the federation of eleven IoT deployments (from heterogeneous application domains) with over 10,000 IoT devices overall which produce hundreds of thousands of observations per day.},

A framework to facilitate reputation-based service selection in semantic grids is presented. The proposed framework has two key features that distinguish it from other work in this area. First, an adaptive reputation-aware service discovery algorithm is provided. Second, a service-oriented distributed reputation assessment algorithm is presented.

 abstract = {Extended Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) has recently gained a lot of attention from the industrial and research community for dynamic Internet of Things (IoT) applications. IoT devices broadcast messages for neighbor gateways that deliver the message to the application server through an IP network. Hence, it is required to deploy LoRaWAN gateways, i.e., network planning, and optimization, in an environment while considering Operational Expenditure (OPEX) and Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) along with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this article, we introduced a LoRaWAN gateway placement model for dynamic IoT applications called DPLACE. It divides the IoT devices into groups with some degree of similarity between them to allow for the placement of LoRaWAN gateways that can serve these devices in the best possible way. Specifically, DPLACE computes the number of LoRaWAN gateways based on the Gap statistics method. Afterward, DPLACE uses K-Means and Fuzzy C-means algorithms to calculate the LoRaWAN gateway placement. The simulations' results proved the benefits of DPLACE compared to state-of-the-art LoRaWAN gateway placement models in terms of OPEX, CAPEX, and QoS.},

 abstract = {Low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) technologies,such as LoRaWAN, have become a popular and cost-effective way of monitoring assets. Two considerations which still present a barrier to deployment are the cost of deployment and the potential cost and disruption of re-keying a compromised network. This loss of functionality from a compromised network has made security conscious industries reluctant to embrace LPWAN technology. This paper will address these concerns by simplifying the deployment and re-keying of LoRaWAN devices, by detailing a procedure which uses a smartphone’s camera flash to transfer the necessary credentials. Smartphones were chosen as a transfer mechanism since they are both abundant and suitably powerful to generate and transfer secure keys. Using smartphones and light also removes the need for a laptop, a wired connection and programming software, allowing devices to be provisioned out in the field without the need for calibration or specialised tools. The design was created and successfully programs sensor devices in variety of environments, and has demonstrated benefits to critical national infrastructure industries such as utilities.},

Comparable state-of-the-art solutions, require human interaction to access the data or require high power consumption or space requirements, or they are based on centralized architectures. The proposed pollution monitoring system here, on one hand, employs LoRa to address the high power consumption and long-range transmission challenges of IoT protocols. On the other hand, it is designed to be fully decentralized by using the Ethereum Blockchain to store and retrieve the data recorded by IoT sensors. Thus, data integrity is provided without the need for a Trusted Third Party (TTP) and data is collected and captured automatically without any manual operations needed. Observations on the four different types of sensors for measuring Potential Hydrogen (PH), Turbidity, Carbon monoxide (CO), and Carbon dioxide (CO2), revealed a high accuracy with the expected time-lines of measurements, non-falsified experimental values collected and can be used as reliable evidence of presence of pollution.},

More than ten years later, the fragmentation of the IoT landscape has dramatically increased as a consequence of the exponential growth of connected devices, making interoperability one of the key issues for most IoT deployments. Contextually, many studies have demonstrated the applicability of Web technologies on IoT scenarios, while the joint efforts from the academia and the industry have led to the proposals of standard specifications for developing WoT systems. Through a systematic review of the literature, we provide a detailed illustration of the WoT paradigm for both researchers and newcomers, by reconstructing the temporal evolution of key concepts and the historical trends, providing an in-depth taxonomy of software architectures and enabling technologies of WoT deployments and, finally, discussing the maturity of WoT vertical markets. Moreover, we identify some future research directions that may open the way to further innovation on WoT systems.},

 abstract = {Energy efficiency and data security of smart grids are one of the major concerns in the context of implementing modern approaches in smart cities. For the intelligent management of energy systems, wireless sensor networks and advanced metering infrastructures have played an essential role in the transformation of traditional cities into smart communities. In this paper, a smart city energy model is proposed in which prosumer communities were built by interconnecting energy self-sufficient households to generate, consume and share clean energy on a decentralized trading platform by integrating blockchain technology with a smart microgrid. The efficiency and stability of the grid network were improved by using several wireless sensor nodes that manage a massive amount of data in the network. However, long communication distances between sensor nodes and the base station can greatly consume the energy of sensors and decrease the network lifespan. Therefore, bio-inspired algorithm approaches were proposed to improve routing by obtaining the shortest path for traversing the entire network and increasing the system performance in terms of the efficient selection of cluster heads, reduced energy consumption, and extended network lifetime. This was carried out by studying the properties and mechanisms of biological systems and applying them in the communication systems in order to obtain the best results for a specific problem. In this comprehensive model, particle swarm optimization and a genetic algorithm are used to search for the optimal solution in any problem space in less processing time.},

The availability of different service description methods can give developers a range of options to choose from so that they can have an appropriate description method that fits best their services. [Question/problem] But there is neither holistic information on service description methods nor a clear understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each service description method. The aim of this paper is to identify problems of service descriptions that have been researched so far, and the techniques or methods available to tackle these problems. [Principle ideas/results] Thus, to gather this relevant information available in the literature, a systematic review was conducted. A total of 191 articles were examined, of which 24 articles focus on service description related concepts. The results show that, despite the recent efforts in describing the nonfunctional requirements of services through approaches like semantic annotations and policy attachments, there is still a lot to do in enhancing the description of quality aspects of services. Furthermore, this study reveals that a negligible effort is given to the description of consumer oriented services. [Contribution] This paper identifies and analyzes the current service description methods that exist in the literature and explains the pros and cons inherent to these methods.},

Many businesses are now incorporating sensor data directly into their business systems. Solutions need to be found to create an efficient connection to the business systems, ensuring these systems are not directly interfacing with the sensors. This is done to reduce the complexity on both sides and reduce the resources required by the sensor. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) provides an optimal solution for most Internet of Things systems when dealing with many sensors, unfortunately it is not compatible with most business systems. The Constrained Application Protocol (COAP) provides better compatibility when dealing with business systems due to the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) compatibility. The optimal solution then seems to use the two systems in unison to provide strengths to the other systems’ weaknesses.},

Overall, the goal of the WoT is to preserve and complement existing IoT standards and solutions. In general, the W3C WoT architecture is designed to describe what exists rather than to prescribe what to implement.

This WoT Architecture specification describes the abstract architecture for the W3C Web of Things. This abstract architecture is based on a set of requirements that were derived from use cases for multiple application domains, both given in this document. A set of modular building blocks are also identified whose detailed specifications are given in other documents. This document describes how these building blocks are related and work together. The WoT abstract architecture defines a basic conceptual framework that can be mapped onto a variety of concrete deployment scenarios, several examples of which are given. However, the abstract architecture described in this specification does not itself define concrete mechanisms or prescribe any concrete implementation.},

 abstract = {W3C Web of Things enables applications to interact with and orchestrate connected Things at Web scale. The standardized abstract interaction model exposed by the WoT Thing Description enables applications to scale and evolve independently of the individual Things.

Many network-level protocols and standards for connected Things have already been developed, and have millions of devices deployed in the field today. These standards are converging on a common set of transport protocols and transfer layers, but each has peculiar content formats, payload schemas, and data types.

Despite using unique formats and data models, the high-level interactions exposed by most connected things can be modeled using the Property, Action, and Event interaction affordances of the WoT Thing Description.

Binding Templates enable a Thing Description to be adapted to the specific protocol or data payload usage across the different standards. This is done through additional descriptive vocabulary that is used in the Thing Description.

This document describes the initial set of vocabulary extensions to the WoT Thing Description that make up the Binding Templates. It is expected over time that additional protocols and payload structures will be accommodated by further extending the Binding Templates.}

 abstract = {The W3C Web of Things (WoT) is intended to enable interoperability across IoT platforms and application domains. One key mechanism for accomplishing this goal is the definition and use of metadata describing the interactions an IoT device or service makes available over the network at a suitable level of abstraction. The WoT Thing Description specification satisfies this objective.

However, in order to use a Thing its Thing Description first has to be obtained. The WoT Discovery process described in this document addresses this problem. WoT Discovery needs to support the distribution of WoT Thing Descriptions in a variety of use cases. This includes ad-hoc and engineered systems; during development and at runtime; and on both local and global networks. The process also needs to work with existing discovery mechanisms, be secure, protect private information, and be able to efficiently handle updates to WoT Thing Descriptions and the dynamic and diverse nature of the IoT ecosystem.

The WoT Discovery process is divided into two phases, Introduction, and Exploration. The Introduction phase leverages existing discovery mechanisms but does not directly expose metadata; they are simply used to discover Exploration services, which provide metadata but only after secure authentication and authorization. This document normatively defines two Exploration services, one for WoT Thing self-description with a single WoT Thing Description and a searchable WoT Thing Description Directory service for collections of Thing Descriptions. A variety of Introduction services are also described and where necessary normative definitions are given to support them.}

The Web of Things is descriptive, not prescriptive, and so is generally designed to support the security models and mechanisms of the systems it describes, not introduce new ones. However, a WoT System also has its own unique assets, such as a Scripting API and Thing Descriptions, that need to be protected and also have security and privacy implications.

We define the general security requirements for a Web of Things (WoT) System using a threat model. The WoT threat model defines the main security stakeholders, security-relevant assets, possible attackers, attack surfaces, and finally threats for a WoT System. Using this generic WoT threat model for guidance, it should be possible to select a specific set of security objectives for a concrete WoT System implementation. We provide several examples using common scenarios based on home, enterprise, and industrial use cases. We also provide more general suggestions for the design and deployment of a secure WoT System. All recommendations are linked to the corresponding WoT threats in the generic WoT threat model in order to facilitate understanding of why they are needed.

It is not the intention of this document to limit the set of security mechanisms that can be used to secure a WoT System. In particular, while we provide examples and recommendations based on the best available practices in the industry, this document contains informative statements only. Specific normative security aspects of the WoT specification are defined in the corresponding normative WoT documents for each WoT building block.}

Thing Descriptions provide a set of interactions based on a small vocabulary that makes it possible both to integrate diverse devices and to allow diverse applications to interoperate. Thing Descriptions, by default, are encoded in a JSON format that also allows JSON-LD processing. The latter provides a powerful foundation to represent knowledge about Things in a machine-understandable way. A Thing Description instance can be hosted by the Thing itself or hosted externally when a Thing has resource restrictions (e.g., limited memory space) or when a Web of Things-compatible legacy device is retrofitted with a Thing Description.},

 abstract = {The Web of Things aims to make physical world objects and their data accessible through standard Web technologies to enable intelligent applications and sophisticated data analytics. Due to the amount and heterogeneity of the data, it is challenging to perform data analysis directly; especially when the data is captured from a large number of distributed sources. However, the size and scope of the data can be reduced and narrowed down with search techniques, so that only the most relevant and useful data items are selected according to the application requirements. Search is fundamental to the Web of Things while challenging by nature in this context, e.g., mobility of the objects, opportunistic presence and sensing, continuous data streams with changing spatial and temporal properties, efficient indexing for historical and real time data. The research community has developed numerous techniques and methods to tackle these problems as reported by a large body of literature in the last few years. A comprehensive investigation of the current and past studies is necessary to gain a clear view of the research landscape and to identify promising future directions. This survey reviews the state-of-the-art search methods for the Web of Things, which are classified according to three different viewpoints: basic principles, data/knowledge representation, and contents being searched. Experiences and lessons learned from the existing work and some EU research projects related to Web of Things are discussed, and an outlook to the future research is presented.},

@article{Zhao.2017,
 abstract = {As the adoption of service-oriented paradigms in the IoT (Internet of Things) environment, real-world devices will open their capabilities through service interfaces, which enable other functional entities to interact with them. In an IoT application, it is indispensable to find suitable services for satisfying users' requirements or replacing the unavailable services. However, from the perspective of performance, it is inappropriate to find desired services from the service repository online directly. Instead, clustering services offline according to their similarity and matchmaking or discovering service online in limited clusters is necessary. This paper proposes a multidimensional model-based approach to measure the similarity between IoT services. Then, density-peaks-based clustering is employed to gather similar services together according to the result of similarity measurement. Based on the service clustering, the algorithms of dynamic service matchmaking, discovery, and replacement will be performed efficiently. Evaluating experiments are conducted to validate the performance of proposed approaches, and the results are promising.},

  abstract = {IoT is often associated with low-power wireless, where best-effort communication is sufficient for many of its applications. Yet, in particular in Industrial IoT, strict quality of service (QoS) guarantees are required to enable deterministic real-time applications. Hence, wired communications are still predominant here, with Ethernet having become the main media for the industrial fieldbuses such as PROFINET, EtherCAT, or the emerging Field-Level Communications (FLC) of OPC UA. With the addition of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), an IEEE standards family for deterministic networking over Ethernet, Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) can converge even at the shopfloor, as TSN-enabled Ethernet allows for several traffic types to co-exist in the same network. This paper proposes an extension to the W3C Web of Things (WoT) for semantics-enabled connectivity, which allows to cover application QoS requirements and network configuration within the W3C WoT abstractions. We contribute a QoS vocabulary for the W3C WoT Thing Description as well as design and open-source implementation of protocol bindings for OPC UA and NETCONF. Moreover, we discuss the challenges and pitfalls when designing new protocol bindings for W3C WoT.},
